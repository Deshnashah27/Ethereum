								<h2>History of Blockchain</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>1991 : The research scientists Stuart Haber and W.Scott Stornetta presented a computationally practical solution for time stamping digital documents so that they could not be tampered.</li>
										<li>1998 : The scientist, Nick Szabo works on "Bit Gold" decentalized digital currency</li>
										<li>2004 : A computer scientist and cryptographic activist named Hal Finney introduced a system called Reusable Proof of Work(RPoW) for digital cash.It worked by obtaining a non-fungible or a non-exchangable handcash based proof of work token in return. He created an RSA signed token that further could be transferred from one person to another.</li>
										<li>2008 : Satoshi Nakamoto, wrote a paper named "Bitcon :A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash System". He introduced the term chain of blocks and explained the concept of distributed blockchain.</li>
										<li>2009 : Nakamoto implemented the first blockchain as per public ledger, for public transactions made using bitcoin.</li>
										<li>2014 : Blockchain evolution is steady and promising. It has become a need in various fields.</li>
									</ul>
								<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
								<p>Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain which was introduced by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. It is the first cryptocurrency in the world. It follows exact same structure as a typical blockchain of P2P shared network. It is a decentralized digital currency that can be transferred on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network.</p>
